# üåü Literals in Python :-

In Python, **literals** are notations for representing fixed values. They are the basic building blocks of a program, used to create variables or constants. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of different types of literals in Python:

### 1. Numeric Literals
These represent numeric values and can be of three types:

- **Integer Literals**: Whole numbers, positive or negative (e.g., `10`, `-5`, `0`).
- **Float Literals**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`).
- **Complex Literals**: Numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., `3 + 4j`, `2 - 5j`).

### 2. Integer Literals
- **Definition**: Whole numbers without a decimal point. They can be positive, negative, or zero.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  a = 42           # Positive integer
  b = -17          # Negative integer
  c = 0            # Zero
  ```

### 3. Float Literals
- **Definition**: Numbers that contain a decimal point. They can also be expressed in scientific notation.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  x = 3.14        # Standard float
  y = -0.001      # Negative float
  z = 2.0e3       # Scientific notation (2.0 * 10^3, equals 2000.0)
  ```

### 4. Complex Literals
- **Definition**: Numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part, represented with a `j` or `J`.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  c1 = 3 + 4j    # Real part is 3, imaginary part is 4
  c2 = -2 - 3j   # Real part is -2, imaginary part is -3
  c3 = 1j        # Imaginary unit, equivalent to 0 + 1j
  ```

### 5. String Literals
- **Definition**: Sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, triple single quotes, or triple double quotes.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  str1 = 'Hello, World!'           # Single quotes
  str2 = "Python is fun."           # Double quotes
  str3 = '''This is a multi-line
  string.'''                       # Triple single quotes
  str4 = """This is also a multi-line
  string."""                        # Triple double quotes
  ```

### 6. Boolean Literals
- **Definition**: Represents truth values, which can be either `True` or `False`.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  is_active = True         # Boolean true
  is_closed = False        # Boolean false
  ```

### 7. Special Literals
- **Definition**: In Python, the `None` literal represents the absence of a value or a null value.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  result = None           # Represents no value
  ```

### Summary of Literals
Here's a consolidated view of all the examples:

```python
# Integer literals
a = 42
b = -17
c = 0

# Float literals
x = 3.14
y = -0.001
z = 2.0e3

# Complex literals
c1 = 3 + 4j
c2 = -2 - 3j
c3 = 1j

# String literals
str1 = 'Hello, World!'
str2 = "Python is fun."
str3 = '''This is a multi-line
string.'''
str4 = """This is also a multi-line
string."""

# Boolean literals
is_active = True
is_closed = False

# Special literal
result = None
```

### üìö Summary
Literals are fundamental to programming in Python, allowing you to create variables and control flow based on fixed values. üêç‚ú®
