# Variables in Python üì¶

A **variable** is a name that refers to a memory location used to store data. In Python, variables can store data of different types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, etc. Unlike some programming languages, Python doesn‚Äôt require you to explicitly declare the data type of the variable. Python automatically assigns the data type based on the value you assign to the variable.

### Declaring Variables in Python üìù

You declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the `=` operator.

```python
x = 5  # x is an integer
name = "John"  # name is a string
pi = 3.14  # pi is a floating-point number
```

- In this example:
  - `x` is an integer (`5`)
  - `name` is a string (`"John"`)
  - `pi` is a float (`3.14`)

### Variable Assignment and Reassignment üîÑ

Python variables can be reassigned to different data types at any point in the program. This is because Python is a **dynamically typed language**.

```python
x = 5       # x is an integer
x = "Hello" # x is now a string
x = 3.14    # x is now a float
```

---

### Multiple Assignments üìä

You can assign values to multiple variables in a single line.

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # Multiple assignments in a single line
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3

# Assign the same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 100
print(x, y, z)  # Output: 100 100 100
```

### Rules for Naming Variables in Python üõ†Ô∏è

When naming variables, you must follow certain rules to ensure your code runs correctly.

1. **Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`)**:
   - A variable can start with a lowercase or uppercase letter, e.g., `name`, `Name`, `age`, `Age`.
   - You can also start with an underscore, e.g., `_count`.

2. **Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores**:
   - After the first letter, you can use letters, numbers, or underscores.
   - Examples: `age2`, `count_`, `total_value`, `_privateVar`.

3. **No spaces or special characters allowed**:
   - You cannot use spaces in variable names. Instead, use underscores (`_`) to separate words.
   - Example: Use `first_name` instead of `first name`.
   - Special characters like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc., are not allowed in variable names.

4. **Case-sensitive**:
   - Python is case-sensitive, which means `age` and `Age` are treated as two different variables.
   - Example:
     ```python
     age = 25
     Age = 30
     print(age)  # Output: 25
     print(Age)  # Output: 30
     ```

5. **Avoid Python reserved keywords**:
   - Variable names should not be Python keywords (reserved words that have specific meanings in the language).
   - Some Python keywords include: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `return`, `try`, `except`, `import`, `class`, `def`, etc.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # This is not allowed because 'if' is a Python keyword
     if = 10  # SyntaxError
     ```

#### Example of a Valid Variable Name:
```python
my_variable = 10
_user_age = 25
item_count = 100
```

#### Example of Invalid Variable Names:
```python
2count = 5     # Starts with a number (invalid)
my variable = 10  # Contains a space (invalid)
my-name = "John"  # Contains a hyphen (invalid)
class = "Math"  # 'class' is a keyword (invalid)
```

---

### Best Practices for Naming Variables üéØ

1. **Use descriptive names**:
   - Choose variable names that describe the data being stored. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
   - Example:
     ```python
     num_students = 50  # Descriptive name
     s = 50  # Not descriptive
     ```

2. **Follow conventions**:
   - The standard convention for Python variable names is to use **lowercase letters** and separate words with underscores (known as **snake_case**).
   - Example: `student_count`, `total_price`, `is_valid`.

3. **Use lowercase for variables and functions, and CapitalizedWords for classes**:
   - This is a widely accepted convention in the Python community.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         pass

     total_amount = 100
     ```

4. **Use underscores for private variables**:
   - In some cases, a leading underscore is used to indicate that a variable is private to a class or module.
   - Example:
     ```python
     _internal_value = 42  # Conventionally considered private
     ```

### Variable Scope üåê

A variable‚Äôs **scope** refers to the part of the program where it can be accessed. In Python, variables can either be **global** or **local**.

- **Global Variables**: Defined outside of any function or block and can be accessed anywhere in the code.
  ```python
  x = 10  # Global variable

  def func():
      print(x)  # Access global variable

  func()  # Output: 10
  ```

- **Local Variables**: Defined inside a function or block and can only be accessed within that function or block.
  ```python
  def func():
      y = 5  # Local variable
      print(y)

  func()  # Output: 5
  # print(y)  # This would cause an error because 'y' is not accessible outside the function.
  ```

### Summary üìù
- Variables are containers for storing data values, and they do not require explicit declaration of data types.
- Variables can store different types of data such as integers, floats, strings, etc.
- Variable names must follow specific rules (e.g., no special characters or spaces, must start with a letter or underscore).
- Python is case-sensitive, so `var` and `Var` are different variables.
- Global variables are accessible throughout the program, while local variables are confined to their respective functions or blocks.
